# **Train-Times**
A project completed for my certificate at UCF Coding Bootcamp.

### **Project Description**
-------------------------------------------
This project used firebase and begins my foray into backend web development. A form is included at the bottom of the page, that allows a user to input a new train, its start time and its frequency. The next train is calculated and displayed using Moment.js, jQuery, and firebase methods. The number of minutes until the next train are updated every minute using a setInterval function. 

Add a new train by filling out all the fields and clicking the submit button. The new train will be added to the chart with values that are updated every minute.
